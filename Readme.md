🎮 Steam Games Analysis & Recommendation System (2021–2025)

Welcome, curious reader! 👋
This project explores the Steam Games dataset (2021–2025), featuring 65,000+ game entries, to uncover trends in game releases, categories, and pricing. Beyond analysis, the notebook also builds a basic recommendation prediction model to understand how games can be suggested based on available features.

If you find this project helpful or insightful, consider ⭐ starring the repository or 👍 upvoting the notebook.

📌 Project Objectives

Analyze trends in game releases over time

Explore categories, pricing patterns, and distributions

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing for real-world datasets

Build a simple predictive model for game recommendations

Practice an end-to-end data analysis and modeling workflow

📂 Dataset Overview

Source: Steam Games Dataset

Time Period: 2021 – 2025

Size: 65,000+ entries

Key Attributes:

Release dates

Game categories

Pricing information

Metadata used for recommendation modeling

🧭 Table of Contents

Data Loading

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Predictor: Recommendation Prediction

Conclusion and Future Work

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

Python

NumPy – numerical computations

Pandas – data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

Scikit-learn – model building and evaluation

Matplotlib backends are configured to ensure smooth plotting across environments, and warnings are suppressed for cleaner outputs.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA section focuses on:

Year-wise and trend-based release analysis

Distribution of game categories

Pricing insights (free vs paid, price ranges)

Visual patterns that influence recommendations

🤖 Recommendation Prediction Model

A modest machine learning model is built using:

Train-test split for evaluation

Linear Regression as a baseline predictor

R² score to measure model performance

This model serves as a foundation for understanding recommendation logic rather than a production-level system.

🚀 Conclusion & Future Work

Key Takeaways:

Steam’s catalog shows clear trends in release frequency and pricing strategies

Proper preprocessing significantly improves analysis quality

Even simple models can offer useful recommendation insights

Future Enhancements:

Use collaborative filtering or content-based filtering

Add NLP on game descriptions and tags

Experiment with advanced machine learning models

Improve evaluation metrics for recommendations
